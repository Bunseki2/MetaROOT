Using metamap to make sequencing metadata machine readable (and learnable!)

# What is Metadata?
Metadata is data about data. It is the descriptive information (like identity, time, location, etc.) that explains the nature and details of information. When thoroughly collected with standardized ontology, metadata enables you to understand, use, and share your own data now and in the future, and helps other researchers discover, access, use, repurpose, and cite your data in the long-term. It also facilitates long-term archival preservation of the data.

# What is the problem?
Most biomedical metadata is collected in a heavily variable manner, and is not standardized and translatable to other research studies or even future work from the same group. In the era of big data, this has become a quintessential issue to getting the greatest use and understanding out of the wealth of data being collected. Though harmonizing metadata can sometimes be done post-hoc, it would be significantly more efficient to collect metadata according to standard ontology in the field that would ensure data completeness and translation.

# Why should we solve it?
Though many fields are beginning to develop standards for what metadata to collect across different data types, this area still needs a lot of work and tools to help make it easier for scientists and researchers to know what metadata variables to collect and how to collect them. Improving and standardizing metadata collection could revolutionize the the knowledge gained from the paucity of metadata being produced. 

# What is MetaROOT?
The Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR) has created tools for collecting, editing and analyzing metadata, but it requires significant manual input from the user.
