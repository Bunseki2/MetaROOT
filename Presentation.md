# What is Metadata?
Metadata is data about data: 
Essential information (like identity, time, location, etc.) about the data. 

When described with standardized ontology, metadata enables other researchers to discover, access, use, repurpose, and cite your data 

# Data: 
## Sequences in SRA, TSA, WGS

# BioProject: 
## Metadata about the study
Accession Number e.g. PRJNA450707
Title and text summary  

# BioSample: 
## Metadata about an individual sample of the study

Field Identifier: e.g. SAMN05771540 Sample name: P4-2; SRA: SRS1702951
Attributes about each sample: Sex, Age, Isolate, tissue, disease, cell line, cell type......
(Author can add own attribute)

# Strategy: For BioProject
use MeSH on Demand for a use case 
Polycystic ovarian syndrome
Edirect search: esearch -db bioproject -query "polycystic ovarian syndrome" | efetch -format docsum | xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Project_Acc Project_Description > Downloads/PCOS_BioProject_Descriptions_v2

# Strategy: For BioSample
use MetaMap on attribute field entries
## Edirect search: 
./esearch -db bioSample -query "human [orgn]" | ./efetch -format docsum | ./xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Accession Attribute@attribute_name Attribute

Score threshold:10

Score â€“ MetaMap Indexing (MMI) score with a maximum score of 1000.00.  The higher the score, the greater the relevance of the UMLS concept according to the MMI algorithm.  The MMI results are presented in highest to lowest relevance order. score info https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/MetaMapLite.shtml
