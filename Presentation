What is Metadata?
Metadata is data about data. It is the descriptive information (like identity, time, location, etc.) that explains the nature and details of information. When thoroughly collected with standardized ontology, metadata enables you to understand, use, and share your own data now and in the future, and helps other researchers discover, access, use, repurpose, and cite your data in the long-term. It also facilitates long-term archival preservation of the data.
